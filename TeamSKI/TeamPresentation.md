# Team SKI - Selective Kinase Inhibitors
## Research
The group is dedicated to develop computational methods that impact hit identification and lead optmization in preclinical R&D projects. In particular, we are working on innovative solutions that support the rational design and identification of selective kinase inhibitors. Our research is focussed on understanding and predicting the determinants of binding processes as well as mining compound profiling data to faciliate the transfer of SAR information; the techniques developed and applied by us are grounded in bio- and cheminformatics.
#### Research Sponsor
